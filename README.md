## Description

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional replica of [Airbnb's website](https://www.airbnb.com/) using our server. It includes:
  - A debuging and development command interpreter, that allows you to manipulate data without using a visual interface
  - A front-end website with static and dynamic functionality 
  - An API that offers a communication link between the system's front and backend. 
  - A robust database for managing backend functions
